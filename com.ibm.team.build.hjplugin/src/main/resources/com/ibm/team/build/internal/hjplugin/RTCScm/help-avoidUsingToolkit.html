  <p>
   Where possible avoid using the Build toolkit when performing tasks on the Master.
   This is still in the experimental stage. You will require an RTC 5.0 server which
   provides some of the services used. 
  </p>
  <p>
   The Build toolkit will not be used when polling RTC and terminating the RTC Build. The toolkit
   is still required though. It is used for other configuration tasks on the Master
   (i.e. validating the connection to RTC, the build definition or workspace).
   It is also used for checkout tasks typically performed on agent nodes.
