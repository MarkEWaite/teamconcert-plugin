   Logs and artifacts can be grouped under a component in the build result. By providing a component name, you can uniquely identify a log or artifact, especially when there are multiple logs or artifacts with the same file name across different components but not within the same component.

   If there are multiple logs or artifacts with the same file name under a component, use the Content ID field to uniquely identify the contribution.

  If you leave this field blank, the first log or artifact that matches the file name will be retrieved.
